    "Now consider the buyer's expense minimization problem. Assume the buyer has a valuation $v$ in case the good is delivered to her. Her net utility is $v-\\min_i b_i$ if she buys the good. Normalize her utility to 0 if she does not buy the good.\n",

    "You are consulting the buyer how to maximize her utility by choosing a reserve price $r$. In a procurement auction, the auction is canceled in case no seller bids below $r$. Derive the first-order condition for optimal reserve $r$ of the buyer. Assume that the hazard rate $F(x)/f(x)$ is increasing and show that the second-order condition is satisfied under this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint 1*: You don't have to derive the equilibrium bidding strategies of a first-price procurement auction with a reserve price. It's much simpler to use revenue equivalence and consider a second-price auction, the optimal reserve price for a first-price auction is the same as for a second-price auction. In the context of a procurement auctions, a second-price auction is the following: the seller with the lowest bid wins the auction and is paid the second lowest bid. If there is a reserve price, the lowest bidder is paid the second lowest bid or the reserve price, whichever is lower. Formally, if seller $i$ wins the auction, he receives the payment $\\min\\{r, \\min_{i\\neq j} b_j\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint 2*: The optimal reserve price in a second-price procurement auction is the same irrespective of the number of sellers. So it's simpler to derive the optimal reserve for one seller."
